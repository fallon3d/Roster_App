# Coach-Only Football Rotation Generator

This Streamlit app helps coaches generate balanced offensive and defensive rotations from a player roster, enforcing fairness and position eligibility. All key constraints (minimum guarantee, evenness cap, position preferences) are honored, with prompts for any exceptions. The UI is coach-only with a simple PIN gate.
